      <p>Make sure you allow enough time for any necessary security checks which may include random searches. Bringing bags to the stadium is actively discouraged. However, fans arriving at the stadium with a small personal bag (i.e. handbag/medical bag) should expect this to be searched and tagged before entry. Bringing a bag may delay your entry and in some cases may lead to non-entry to the stadium.

Please do not bring large bags or luggage (such as rucksacks/briefcases/suitcases/suit bags etc.) to Anfield as they cannot be brought into the stadium.
