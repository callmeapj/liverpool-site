# liverpool-site
A sample of an official website of Liverpool Football Club.
It includes a basic layout of the whole website with navigation bar,images,videos and spotify playlist embedded in it.
It also inlcudes a sign in and sign up pagealong with how one should connect to php database and how it should be accessed.
It is just an attempt to create something similar to orginal website.
